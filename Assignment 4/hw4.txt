2. To create a new branch of version 3.0 or Diffutils, I called "git checkout v3.0 -b quote".

3. Then I patched the branch with quote-3.0-patch.txt with "patch -p1 <../quote-3.0-patch.txt" since my quote-3.0-patch.txt was outside the diffutils directory.

5. I opened up ChangeLog and ChangeLog-2008 simultaneously with emacs. Then I referred to the old changelog to see how I should format the new changelog. Since all files in the patch are modified the same way, I put the same message for all the files which was "replaced backticks with apostrophes for string constants."

6. I then added and committed all the files with "git add *.c" and "git commit -af ChangeLog"

7. After that I used "git format-patch -1 --stdout>formatted-patch.txt" to generate a patch for the commit. the -1 denotes the number of commits from the top to generate the patch from, and the --stdout allows us to specify the output file.

8. To test whether the formatted patch was correct, I called "git checkout v3.0 -b partner" to create a temporary branch to test the patch on. I then called "git am < ../formatted-patch.txt" to apply the patch since I moved formatted-patch.txt outside of diffutils before this step. Finally I built the Diffutils like in step 14 of the lab to see whether or not the patch was applied correctly by using "make check"

9. Running "make distdir" and then "diffutils*/ChangeLog" I managed to get the same ChangeLog as the one I wrote, and as a result ChangeLog worked.
