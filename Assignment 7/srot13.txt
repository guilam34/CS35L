On average the compiled srot13u program was much slower than srot13 due to the
fact that it makes system calls for every byte in the input file. It is
important to note however that for small files srot13 and srot13u exhibit
little to no performance differences due to the individual system calls in
srot13u not being substantial enough to affect the overall runtime of the
program.

Small file:
srot13: 0.003s
srot13u: 0.002s

Large file:
srot13: 2.037s
srot13u: 6.345s
