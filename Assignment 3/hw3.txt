Q1: Since we remove the only code in ls that uses "case_long_
iso_time_style," the case is not necessary, but in order to
declutter the code we remove it.

Q2: The patch would be problematic in that there is no way to
make sure that everything uses the same format as the three
field format we set in the assignment. We would have to manaully
change the time formatting if the locale was different since the
modification in the assignment was only for US UTF-8.

Q3:The command stops running and outputs text from the traceback
command. The traceback command explains that there is an index
error which occurs when there is an empty file.

Q4:There is a syntax error because Python 3.0+ cannot iterate
through the list of arguments unlike Python 2. This functionality
is called automatic tuple unpacking and is limited to versions of
Python below 3.0.
