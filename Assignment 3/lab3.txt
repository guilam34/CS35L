First I downloaded Coreutils 7.6 and saved it to my desktop. Then
I used WinSCP to move the .tar file to the seasnet server where I
unpacked it with the "tar" command.

Next I created a directory called coreutilsInstall which is where
CoreUtils 7.6 would be installed. After that I went into the CoreUtils
directory that was created from unpacking the .tar file and ran
"./configure" with the prefix set to the directory coreutilsInstall.
Then I called "make" and "make install" to finish installing CoreUtils.

Then I set the locale to UTF be calling "export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'"
to check if the problem described in the assignment spec was generated
when I called "ls -l /bin/bash." The problem did end up being generated
so I could proceed with the assignment instructions.

After that I went into the src folder in Coreutils-7.6 and opened ls.c
in the emacs editor. I called "M-g g" to jump to the lines numbers
specified in the patch, and inserted and removed lines as necessary.

We get rid of "case_long_iso_time_style" because it is only used in
the for loop beginning at around line 2029. We retain "case
long_iso_time_style" because we still need for it to be able to be
externally called in case we need it for other commands. As for
deleting the large chunk of code around line 2029, it is because we
want to constantly remain in POSIX format, and as a result we can
just use the same code "long_time_format[i]=dcgettext(NULL, long
_time_format[i], LC_TIME)" for each iteration of the loop.

I then called "make" again to recompile everything and instead of
running "ls" I ran "./ls" since the modified ls executable was not
installed but simply compiled. The change to the executable fixed
the bug described in the assignment spec and so the lab was finished.
