1. Setting up the amazon server was simply a matter a following instruction prompted by the UI.

Once I managed to connect to the server, I called wget http://$(python -c 'print "AAA"*n') with the n in the command being in powers of 10.

I somewhat managed to reproduce the error when n was 100000000 with the server outputting the message:
   xmalloc: cannot allocate 300000008 bytes (90177536 bytes allocated)
   Connection to 54.149.33.77 closed
There appeared to be guards against overflow in place so I could not cause the server to crash.

2. VU 505120: The ability to remotely execute code regardless of privilege
      level gives the attacker full control of both server and client domain
   VU 252743: The ability to remotely execute code by expoiting bash would
      potentially give the attacker full network control depending on the
      privilege level of the application in which the bash function is called.
      Lower prioity than 505120 due to the fact that it is restricted by the
      application's privileges
   VU 213119: The ability to grant the attacker full domain control is
      dangerous but less so that the VUs above due to the fact that this is
      isolated on a single domain rather than over an entire network
   VU 447516: Access to sensitive information on a router could open gates
      for more dangerous attacks due to the attacker possing network
      information
   VU 720951: The ability to repeatedly retrieve data does not necessarily
      mean that the attacker would instantaneously be able to retrieve all
      sensitive, secret data. Only dangerous if user/network being attacked
      is in possession of sensitive data.
